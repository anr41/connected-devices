# Assignment 11

## Ashley Roberson 

This week I learned about Debian packages. I learned how they can be used to easily update your device everytime a new version is deployed.  I also learned about reprepro and is widely used as a tool for managing local repositories that hold debian packages.  The thing that surprised me the most this week was how making one small mistake such as accidentally deleting something can make it hard to get back to where you were and how the gpg key seemed to stop working even thoug I kept adding the correct value when needed and pushed it to the keyserver.
